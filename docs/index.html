  <h3 class='center'>Disclaimer</h3>
  <p class='center'>
      Some sprites aren't done yet so you will see a placeholder Bulbasaur on those for now.
      Some abilities are also not yet implemented, so they have been replaced for now.
      Subsequent patches will update sprites and abilities as they are finished in hg-engine.

  <h3 class='center'><a href='./trainers/index.html'>Trainers</a></h3>
  <h3 class='center'>TL;DR Changes</h3>
  <ul class='center'>
      <li>
          All trainer battles are Double Battles (except first rival battle)
      </li>
      <li>
          Non-legendary Pokémon Gens 1-9 are available in the game and fully rebalanced.
      </li>
      <li>
          Mega evolution and alternate forms (for the most part) are available - check Mahogany Town
      </li>
      <li>
          This is a difficulty hack but it's not intended to be impossible
      </li>
      <li>
          Rage Candy Bar guy no longer stops you from going towards Route 44
      </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class='center'>Pokémon Changes</h3>
  <ul class='center'>
      <li>
          Includes type changes, ability changes, and role changes
      </li>
      <li>
          Much better Pokémon availability. Wiki contains location information for each. All should be available before the Elite 4
      </li>
      <li>
          More Eviolite Pokémon should be viable
      </li>
      <li>
          Refer to the wiki for specifics but every non-legendary Pokémon has been rebalanced. The goal is for all Pokémon to be viable (even outside of Mega Evolution) so many have received significant buffs
      </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class='center'>Item Changes</h3>
  <ul class='center'>
      <li>
          Held items (except berries) are returned to you at the end of the battle
      </li>
      <li>
          Cannot use healing items in battle (held items still work)
      </li>
      <li>
          Poké Marts are the primary way in which new items are added to this hack so check them out in each town
      </li>
      <li>
          Nature-changing mints are available throughout the game in Poké Marts
      </li>
      <li>
          Eviolite prevents regular evolution
      </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class='center'>EVs/IVs Changes</h3>
  <ul class='center'>
      <li>
          IVs are "lucky" meaning you will most likely end up with 30 IVs in each stat though 0 and 31 are still possible and as likely as they are in vanilla
      </li>
      <li>
          All Pokémon grant 2 EVs in all stats
      </li>
      <li>
          EV/IV viewer in the Pokémon stats panel in-game by pressing L or R
      </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class='center'>Move Changes</h3>
  <ul class='center'>
      <li>
          Re-usable TMs
      </li>
      <li>
          Forgettable HMs
      </li>
      <li>
          Most moves have been rebalanced. Typically reducing RNG elements
      </li>
      <li>
          Evasion increases are no longer present in the game (though accuracy drops still exist)
      </li>
      <li>
          TODO: full docs on this
      </li>
  </ul>
